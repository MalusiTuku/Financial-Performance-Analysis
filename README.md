# Financial Performance Analysis

## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to provide an executive-level view of
financial performance by analysing revenue, profitability, cost
structure, and margin quality over time. The dashboard is designed to
support decision-making around profitability drivers, operating
efficiency, break-even performance, and seasonality effects.
